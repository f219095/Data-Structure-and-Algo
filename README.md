# Data-Structures
**NOTEPAD**

Welcome to my data structures project on GitHub - a text editor with suggestion features! This project was designed to showcase my understanding of data structures concepts such as trees, lists, stacks, and queues.

The text editor includes a suggestion engine that utilizes these data structures to store and retrieve relevant information. Additionally, the project features a application for a more user-friendly experience and utilizes Huffman encoding and decoding for efficient data storage.

I hope you enjoy using the text editor and exploring the code. Feel free to contact me with any questions or comments about the project. Thank you for visiting!
